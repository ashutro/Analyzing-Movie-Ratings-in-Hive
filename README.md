# Analyzing-Movie-Ratings-in-Hive
The "Analyzing Movie Ratings" project uses Apache Hive to manage and analyze movie rating data. Hive, built on Hadoop, allows querying and analysis of large datasets in Hadoop's HDFS. This project sets up Hive, creates tables, loads data, and runs analytical queries to gain insights from movie ratings.
